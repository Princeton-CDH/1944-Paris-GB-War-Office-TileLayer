# 1944-Paris-GB-War-Office-TileLayer 

This repository provides a tile layer of the [1944 map of Paris created by the
Great Britain War
Office](https://maps.princeton.edu/catalog/princeton-2r36tz994), held by
Princeton Libraries.

It is used with permission in the [Shakespeare and Company
Project](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/) that recreates the world of
the Lost Generation in interwar Paris. 

The tile layer was produced by [Moacir P. de Sá
Pereira](http://github.com/muziejus), and this repository includes a short
tutorial on making one’s own tile layer from a GeoTIFF.
